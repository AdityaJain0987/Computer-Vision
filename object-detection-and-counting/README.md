##  Vehicle Detection, Tracking & Speed Estimation using YOLOv8 + ByteTrack + Supervision

This computer vision project demonstrates real-time **vehicle detection**, **multi-object tracking** and **vehicle counting** from traffic surveillance videos using:

*  **YOLOv8** for object detection (Ultralytics)
*  **ByteTrack** for multi-object tracking
*  **Supervision** for annotation, line crossing logic, and video output

>  This project is designed for real-time performance and is ideal for smart traffic monitoring systems.

###  Key Features

* **Vehicle Detection** using YOLOv8 trained on a traffic dataset
* **Object Tracking** with ByteTrack for high accuracy and ID consistency
* **Vehicle Counting** via virtual line crossing
* **Visual Annotations** for bounding boxes, IDs and line crossings
