## 🚗 Vehicle Detection, Tracking & Speed Estimation using YOLOv8 + ByteTrack + Supervision

This computer vision project demonstrates real-time **vehicle detection**, **multi-object tracking**, **vehicle counting**, and **speed estimation** from traffic surveillance videos using:

* 🔍 **YOLOv8** for object detection (Ultralytics)
* 🔁 **ByteTrack** for multi-object tracking
* 📐 **Supervision** for annotation, line crossing logic, and video output

> ✅ This project is designed for real-time performance and is ideal for smart traffic monitoring systems.

### 📌 Key Features

* **Vehicle Detection** using YOLOv8 trained on a traffic dataset
* **Object Tracking** with ByteTrack for high accuracy and ID consistency
* **Vehicle Counting** via virtual line crossing
* **Speed Estimation** by computing travel time between two defined points
* **Visual Annotations** for bounding boxes, IDs, speeds, and line crossings
